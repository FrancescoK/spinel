/* Compile-time values: what Ruby code the compiler runs ahead of time
 * computes -- a class body's macro call (the parse layer's sp_macro.c), a
 * loop over a constant table (sp_const_loop.c) -- and the operations on them
 * the evaluators share. nil, true, false, an Integer within 64 bits, a
 * String, a Symbol, and an Array of these.
 *
 * Nothing here reads a tree: each evaluator walks its own (Prism's nodes, or
 * the node table's) and computes with these. An operation answers 0 where it
 * does not know CRuby's answer for certain (a Bignum, a non-ASCII case
 * mapping, a pattern past the few it follows), and the caller then leaves
 * the code to run when the program does. */
