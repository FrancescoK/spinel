# A method of a module included at the top level is a method of Object. An
# instance of a BasicObject subclass is not an Object, so a bare identifier
# in its instance method does not reach the module and is CRuby's NameError
# (a call written with parentheses is refused at compile time,
# test/reject/basicobject_toplevel_include_call.rb). The class itself is an
# Object: its class methods, and the blocks inside them, still reach the
# module, as do instances of ordinary classes and the top level.
