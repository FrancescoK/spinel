# spinel: not-cruby -- a target the legacy cast cannot reach declines with
# NoMethodError, and an argument of the wrong pointer kind raises TypeError,
# where CRuby makes the call.
# Regression: a boxed bound Method read out of a poly slot may only be invoked
# through the legacy `sp_int (*)(void *, sp_int...)` cast when the call-site
# argument class matches the target's stamped per-position C ABI type. The bind
# sites stamp method_legacy_int_abi as 1 (callable) with a per-position type
# signature, or 0 (decline), and the poly `.call`/`[]` paths compare each
# position's type against it. A target that cannot ride the cast -- a
# float return, a keyword parameter, a rest parameter, a class
# method that needs its receiving class, an argument count that does not match
# the signature, or a pointer of the wrong kind (a String parameter fed an
# IntArray, or an object of another class) -- falls through to NoMethodError
# instead of reading (or being read as) the wrong C type: garbage or a
# segfault.
#
# A parameter nothing typed is no longer one of those cases. It used to be
# pinned to `sp_int`, so a String handed to it would have been read as an
# integer and the gate refused the call; it is poly now, which is what the
# bound-Method ABI carries anyway, so the call goes through and answers what
# CRuby answers (`ptr_to_untyped` below).
#
# A pointer-typed target parameter and a matching pointer argument DO ride the
# cast (the pointer is laundered through the sp_int slot), so that keeps
# working; a mixed int+pointer list works when each position's type matches; an
# optional/defaulted parameter works at FULL arity (the C signature reads every
# fixed slot, so a shorter call declines); a rest parameter ALWAYS declines.
# The callee signature has an extra trailing sp_PolyArray* the cast cannot
# supply, and the callee prologue roots that parameter unconditionally
# (SP_GC_ROOT(lv_<rest>)), so the garbage register the cast left there is
# handed to the collector on the next allocation -- a segfault. Supplying a
# real rest array would need a run-time dispatch on the target's fixed arity,
# which the static cast cannot do, so even an unread rest is declined.
#
# This file defines a user class `call` (Handler) on purpose, so the SHADOWED
# pre-arm serves the `.call` cases; poly_call_fast_abi_gate.rb covers the
# no-user-`call` fast path.
#
# The snapshot is hand-written. Since #4542 a target the stamped ABI cannot
# take rides the per-target thunk its bind site stamped, so most of the
# former declines answer as CRuby does; what still diverges is the thunk's
# boundary check (an argument of another kind than the compiled parameter is
# a TypeError here, where CRuby runs the body with it), a class method that
# takes its class, a bound builtin's wrapper, and the 16-slot cap.
