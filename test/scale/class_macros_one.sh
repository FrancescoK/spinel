# Class-body macros in one class: K calls to a superclass's macro that
# defines two methods each, and (with a second argument, `written`) the
# same 2K define_methods written out in the class. Under --load-model=graph
# the walk splices each call's methods into the one body; a row that walks
# the whole body per splice, rather than once per body, makes the macro
# program cost K^2 more than the written one. (The pair compares the two
# at one K: K methods in one class already cost more than linearly in the
# analysis, macros or not.)
