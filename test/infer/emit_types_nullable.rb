# --emit-types says whether a value whose kind has a nil form of its own can
# be nil: the nullable marking for an Integer or Float (#3505), the nil fact
# for an object or a pointer-held builtin (#7444). A consumer that unboxes on
# the strength of the type needs this beside the type, since `Integer` and
# `Integer?` are one TY_INT. The emit-types leg of infer-test reads this.
