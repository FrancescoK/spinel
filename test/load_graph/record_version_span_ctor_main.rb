# The load record's spans (--dump-load-record,
# record_version_span_ctor_main.rb.load-record) for objects made by a
# constructor named by a Symbol: each class's first ring runs where its
# object is made, so the version before its redefinition is seen
# (unknown: the include changes the chain), never idle. Bell's object is
# made only by a class method's own constructor, which the first `puts`
# runs; Drum has no object until the last line.
# record_version_span_exception_main.rb makes one by exception, by
# method(:new) and by a builder's [].
