# The load record's spans (--dump-load-record,
# record_version_span_exception_main.rb.load-record) for objects made by
# exception, called directly or by raise, by method(:new) and by a
# builder's []: each class's first ring runs where its object is made,
# so the version before its redefinition is seen (unknown: the include
# changes the chain), never idle; Bell has no object until the last
# line. The record only: the compiler does not compile these
# constructors right yet, so the program has no .expected.
