/* sp_system.h -- system()/backtick support in libspinel_rt.a.
 *
 * `sp_last_status` backs Ruby's `$?` (the exit status of the last
 * `system` / backtick). `sp_system_args` runs argv[0] with the rest as
 * arguments (the multi-arg `system(...)` form), setting `sp_last_status`
 * and returning 1 when the child exited 0, 0 for another exit, and -1 when
 * the command could not run (CRuby's true, false and nil; see
 * sp_system_answer). The result is an `int` to stay decoupled from the
 * runtime's typedefs.
