       names the features the compiler's rule for a literal `require "x"`
       maps to a file (`bare`, newline-separated), the native libraries and
       the features loaded already.

       load has its frame) runs it the first time, answering true, and
       answers false after;
     - a native library (`loaded` only): its feature; its flag answers true
