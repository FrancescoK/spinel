# unit_stability.sh -- an edit to one method changes that method's C alone.
#
#   tools/unit_stability.sh [-k K] [SPINEL]
#
# A name the compiler invents must not depend on what stands before it in
# the program, or a diff of the generated C spreads one edit over every
# function after it: a temp numbered across the file, a proc function
# numbered by the procs before it, a literal numbered by its first use, a
# node named by its place in the table. This check generates the scale
# program of test/scale/gen.sh (K units of model / service / presenter),
# compiles it to C with --no-line-map, then compiles three one-line edits
# of its middle unit and counts the lines of C that differ:
#
#   a  a String literal in a method body changes     -> that method only
#   b  a constant a method returns changes (2 -> 3)   -> that method only
#   c  a method's return type changes (2 -> 2.5)      -> that method, the
#      methods its type flows into, the dispatch that calls them
#
# Each edit has a bound on the differing lines; a count over it means a
# name leaked from somewhere else in the program again, and the check
# fails naming the edit. The counts are printed either way.
