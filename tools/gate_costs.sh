# gate_costs.sh -- the run-time cost reports of #7501 as a gate leg.
#
#   tools/gate_costs.sh [REF-REV]
#
# Compares this tree's compiler with the one of REF-REV (default: the
# merge-base of HEAD and origin/master) over the corpus (test/, benchmark/,
# packages/*/test and optcarrot), with
#
#   tools/repr_diff.sh   the representation each slot takes (#7501 item 1)
#   tools/c_costs.sh     the costly constructs in the generated C (item 2)
#
# over the programs whose generated C differs (each compiled once with each
# compiler; an unchanged program is not looked at further),
# and prints their summaries: nothing for a program that did not change, a
# few lines for one that did, small enough to paste into a pull request.
# They are reports, not verdicts: a cost a change brings is explained in
# its pull request, or kept out of the programs that do not need the fix
# (#7501's policy), so this leg does not fail on one. It fails only when it
# cannot run. The reference compiler is built once per revision, in a
# worktree under build/costref/<sha>, and kept for the next run.
#
# On the base itself (HEAD is the reference), or where no reference can be
# found (no origin/master), it says so and passes. The reference is built
# with `make all`: a package's native objects decide how its programs compile.
